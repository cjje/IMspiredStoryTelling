            "1": "but you simply must fit, and peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, peter does some things to you, and after that you fit. once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition.",

            "4": "it was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances. but there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of tinker bell. it could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which tink, who was most fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. no woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined. the couch, as she always called it, was a genuine queen mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season. her mirror was a puss-in-boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic charming the sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of margery and robin. there was a chandelier from tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up."

            "1": "the children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. you must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. when she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on marooners' rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.",

            "4": "but the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for john introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. this is the one mark that john has left on the neverland."

            "4": "she called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other's language. in fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and i wish for the moment i could pretend that this were such a story, and say that peter replied intelligently to the never bird; but truth is best, and i want to tell you only what really happened. well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners."

            "0": "my master's family consisted of two sons, andrew and richard; one daughter, lucretia, and her husband, captain thomas auld. they lived in one house, upon the home plantation of colonel edward lloyd. my master was colonel lloyd's clerk and superintendent. he was what might be called the overseer of the overseers. i spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master's family. it was here that i witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and as i received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, i will give some description of it, and of slavery as it there existed. the plantation is about twelve miles north of easton, in talbot county, and is situated on the border of miles river. the principal products raised upon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat. these were raised in great abundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him, he was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop, in carrying them to market at baltimore. this sloop was named sally lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel's daughters. my master's son-in-law, captain auld, was master of the vessel; she was otherwise manned by the colonel's own slaves. their names were peter, isaac, rich, and jake. these were esteemed very highly by the other slaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for it was no small affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see baltimore.",
            "1": "colonel lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him. the names of the farms nearest to the home plantation were wye town and new design. \"wye town\" was under the overseership of a man named noah willis. new design was under the overseership of a mr. townsend. the overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation. this was the great business place. it was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms. all disputes among the overseers were settled here. if a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to baltimore, and sold to austin woolfolk, or some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining.",
            "2": "here, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food, and their yearly clothing. the men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal. their yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts, one pair of linen trousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter, made of coarse negro cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of shoes; the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars. the allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers, or the old women having the care of them. the children unable to work in the field had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them; their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year. when these failed them, they went naked until the next allowance-day. children from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of the year.",
            "3": "there were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be considered such, and none but the men and women had these. this, however, is not considered a very great privation. they find less difficulty from the want of beds, than from the want of time to sleep; for when their day's work in the field is done, the most of them having their washing, mending, and cooking to do, and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day; and when this is done, old and young, male and female, married and single, drop down side by side, on one common bed,--the cold, damp floor,--each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets; and here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver's horn. at the sound of this, all must rise, and be off to the field. there must be no halting; every one must be at his or her post; and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field; for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the sense of feeling: no age nor sex finds any favor. mr. severe, the overseer, used to stand by the door of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin, ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear, or, from any other cause, was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of the horn.",
            "4": "mr. severe was rightly named: he was a cruel man. i have seen him whip a woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at the time; and this, too, in the midst of her crying children, pleading for their mother's release. he seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendish barbarity. added to his cruelty, he was a profane swearer. it was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk. scarce a sentence escaped him but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath. the field was the place to witness his cruelty and profanity. his presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy. from the rising till the going down of the sun, he was cursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field, in the most frightful manner. his career was short. he died very soon after i went to colonel lloyd's; and he died as he lived, uttering, with his dying groans, bitter curses and horrid oaths. his death was regarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence."

            "0": "colonel lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded almost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener, (mr. m'durmond.) this garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place. during the summer months, people came from far and near--from baltimore, easton, and annapolis--to see it. it abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south. this garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation. its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it. scarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit. the colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden. the last and most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around; after which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had tried to get in. in either case, he was severely whipped by the chief gardener. this plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash. they seemed to realize the impossibility of touching _tar_ without being defiled.",
            "1": "the colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. his stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments. his horses were of the finest form and noblest blood. his carriage-house contained three splendid coaches, three or four gigs, besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style.",
            "2": "this establishment was under the care of two slaves--old barney and young barney--father and son. to attend to this establishment was their sole work. but it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was colonel lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses. the slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited upon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest punishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses--a supposition which he frequently indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young barney a very trying one. they never knew when they were safe from punishment. they were frequently whipped when least deserving, and escaped whipping when most deserving it. every thing depended upon the looks of the horses, and the state of colonel lloyd's own mind when his horses were brought to him for use. if a horse did not move fast enough, or hold his head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his keepers. it was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use. \"this horse has not had proper attention. he has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried, or he has not been properly fed; his food was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or too late; he was too hot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old barney's attending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.\" to all these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word. colonel lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave. when he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was literally the case. i have seen colonel lloyd make old barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time. colonel lloyd had three sons--edward, murray, and daniel,--and three sons-in-law, mr. winder, mr. nicholson, and mr. lowndes. all of these lived at the great house farm, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from old barney down to william wilkes, the coach-driver. i have seen winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back.",
            "3": "to describe the wealth of colonel lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of job. he kept from ten to fifteen house-servants. he was said to own a thousand slaves, and i think this estimate quite within the truth. colonel lloyd owned so many that he did not know them when he saw them; nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him. it is reported of him, that, while riding along the road one day, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual manner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south: \"well, boy, whom do you belong to?\" \"to colonel lloyd,\" replied the slave. \"well, does the colonel treat you well?\" \"no, sir,\" was the ready reply. \"what, does he work you too hard?\" \"yes, sir.\" \"well, don't he give you enough to eat?\" \"yes, sir, he gives me enough, such as it is.\"",
            "4": "the colonel, after ascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the man also went on about his business, not dreaming that he had been conversing with his master. he thought, said, and heard nothing more of the matter, until two or three weeks afterwards. the poor man was then informed by his overseer that, for having found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to a georgia trader. he was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus, without a moment's warning, he was snatched away, and forever sundered, from his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than death. this is the penalty of telling the truth, of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions."

            "0": "mr. hopkins remained but a short time in the office of overseer. why his career was so short, i do not know, but suppose he lacked the necessary severity to suit colonel lloyd. mr. hopkins was succeeded by mr. austin gore, a man possessing, in an eminent degree, all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer. mr. gore had served colonel lloyd, in the capacity of overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or great house farm.",
            "1": "mr. gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. he was artful, cruel, and obdurate. he was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place for such a man. it afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it. he was one of those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly. there must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused. mr. gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,--\"it is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.\" no matter how innocent a slave might be--it availed him nothing, when accused by mr. gore of any misdemeanor. to be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty. to escape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either, under the overseership of mr. gore. he was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch, himself, at the feet of the master. he was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition. he was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience. he was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded by the slaves. his presence was painful; his eye flashed confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without producing horror and trembling in their ranks.",
            "2": "mr. gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled. his words were in perfect keeping with his looks, and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words. overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word, even with the slaves; not so with mr. gore. he spoke but to command, and commanded but to be obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words, and bountifully with his whip, never using the former where the latter would answer as well. when he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. he did nothing reluctantly, no matter how disagreeable; always at his post, never inconsistent. he never promised but to fulfil. he was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness.",
            "3": "his savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge. mr. gore once undertook to whip one of colonel lloyd's slaves, by the name of demby. he had given demby but few stripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, he ran and plunged himself into a creek, and stood there at the depth of his shoulders, refusing to come out. mr. gore told him that he would give him three calls, and that, if he did not come out at the third call, he would shoot him. the first call was given. demby made no response, but stood his ground. the second and third calls were given with the same result. mr. gore then, without consultation or deliberation with any one, not even giving demby an additional call, raised his musket to his face, taking deadly aim at his standing victim, and in an instant poor demby was no more. his mangled body sank out of sight, and blood and brains marked the water where he had stood.",
            "4": "a thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation, excepting mr. gore. he alone seemed cool and collected. he was asked by colonel lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this extraordinary expedient. his reply was, (as well as i can remember,) that demby had become unmanageable. he was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves,--one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation. he argued that if one slave refused to be corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of the whites. mr. gore's defence was satisfactory. he was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation. his fame as an overseer went abroad. his horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation. it was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor testify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives. mr. gore lived in st. michael's, talbot county, maryland, when i left there; and if he is still alive, he very probably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as he was then, as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stained with his brother's blood."

            "3": "i was probably between seven and eight years old when i left colonel lloyd's plantation. i left it with joy. i shall never forget the ecstasy with which i received the intelligence that my old master (anthony) had determined to let me go to baltimore, to live with mr. hugh auld, brother to my old master's son-in-law, captain thomas auld. i received this information about three days before my departure. they were three of the happiest days i ever enjoyed. i spent the most part of all these three days in the creek, washing off the plantation scurf, and preparing myself for my departure.",
            "4": "the pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own. i spent the time in washing, not so much because i wished to, but because mrs. lucretia had told me i must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before i could go to baltimore; for the people in baltimore were very cleanly, and would laugh at me if i looked dirty. besides, she was going to give me a pair of trousers, which i should not put on unless i got all the dirt off me. the thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed! it was almost a sufficient motive, not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange, but the skin itself. i went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with the hope of reward."

            "1": "my mistress was, as i have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when i first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. in entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that i sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. when i went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. there was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. she had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. the first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. she now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. she finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. she was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better. nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. she seemed to think that here lay the danger. i have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension. she was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.",

            "1": "bad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect. my master was one of this rare sort. i do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him. the leading trait in his character was meanness; and if there were any other element in his nature, it was made subject to this. he was mean; and, like most other mean men, he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness. captain auld was not born a slaveholder. he had been a poor man, master only of a bay craft. he came into possession of all his slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst. he was cruel, but cowardly. he commanded without firmness. in the enforcement of his rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax. at times, he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other times, he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way. he did nothing of himself. he might have passed for a lion, but for his ears. in all things noble which he attempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous. his airs, words, and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders, and, being assumed, were awkward enough. he was not even a good imitator. he possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the power. having no resources within himself, he was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, he was forever the victim of inconsistency; and of consequence he was an object of contempt, and was held as such even by his slaves. the luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for. he was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. he found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud. we seldom called him \"master;\" we generally called him \"captain auld,\" and were hardly disposed to title him at all. i doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence fretful. our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly. he wished to have us call him master, but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so. his wife used to insist upon our calling him so, but to no purpose. in august, 1832, my master attended a methodist camp-meeting held in the bay-side, talbot county, and there experienced religion. i indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not do this, it would, at any rate, make him more kind and humane. i was disappointed in both these respects. it neither made him to be humane to his slaves, nor to emancipate them. if it had any effect on his character, it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for i believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before. prior to his conversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty. he made the greatest pretensions to piety. his house was the house of prayer. he prayed morning, noon, and night. he very soon distinguished himself among his brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter. his activity in revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls. his house was the preachers' home. they used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for while he starved us, he stuffed them. we have had three or four preachers there at a time. the names of those who used to come most frequently while i lived there, were mr. storks, mr. ewery, mr. humphry, and mr. hickey. i have also seen mr. george cookman at our house. we slaves loved mr. cookman. we believed him to be a good man. we thought him instrumental in getting mr. samuel harrison, a very rich slaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves. when he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to prayers. when the others were there, we were sometimes called in and sometimes not. mr. cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers. he could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.",
            "2": "while i lived with my master in st. michael's, there was a white young man, a mr. wilson, who proposed to keep a sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the new testament. we met but three times, when mr. west and mr. fairbanks, both class-leaders, with many others, came upon us with sticks and other missiles, drove us off, and forbade us to meet again. thus ended our little sabbath school in the pious town of st. michael's.",
            "3": "i have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty. as an example, i will state one of many facts going to prove the charge. i have seen him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, he would quote this passage of scripture--\"he that knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.\"",
            "4": "master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time. i have known him to tie her up early in the morning, and whip her before breakfast; leave her, go to his store, return at dinner, and whip her again, cutting her in the places already made raw with his cruel lash. the secret of master's cruelty toward \"henny\" is found in the fact of her being almost helpless. when quite a child, she fell into the fire, and burned herself horribly. her hands were so burnt that she never got the use of them. she could do very little but bear heavy burdens. she was to master a bill of expense; and as he was a mean man, she was a constant offence to him. he seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence. he gave her away once to his sister; but, being a poor gift, she was not disposed to keep her. finally, my benevolent master, to use his own words, \"set her adrift to take care of herself.\" here was a recently-converted man, holding on upon the mother, and at the same time turning out her helpless child, to starve and die! master thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them."

            "0": "i had left master thomas's house, and went to live with mr. covey, on the 1st of january, 1833. i was now, for the first time in my life, a field hand. in my new employment, i found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city. i had been at my new home but one week before mr. covey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger. the details of this affair are as follows: mr. covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of january, to the woods, to get a load of wood. he gave me a team of unbroken oxen. he told me which was the in-hand ox, and which the off-hand one. he then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me, if the oxen started to run, that i must hold on upon the rope. i had never driven oxen before, and of course i was very awkward. i, however, succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty; but i had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took fright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and over stumps, in the most frightful manner. i expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees. after running thus for a considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with great force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket. how i escaped death, i do not know. there i was, entirely alone, in a thick wood, in a place new to me. my cart was upset and shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help me. after a long spell of effort, i succeeded in getting my cart righted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart. i now proceeded with my team to the place where i had, the day before, been chopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way to tame my oxen. i then proceeded on my way home. i had now consumed one half of the day. i got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of danger. i stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as i did so, before i could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post. thus twice, in one short day, i escaped death by the merest chance. on my return, i told mr. covey what had happened, and how it happened. he ordered me to return to the woods again immediately. i did so, and he followed on after me. just as i got into the woods, he came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates. he then went to a large gum-tree, and with his axe cut three large switches, and, after trimming them up neatly with his pocketknife, he ordered me to take off my clothes. i made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on. he repeated his order. i still made him no answer, nor did i move to strip myself. upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off my clothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches, cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after. this whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for similar offences.",
            "1": "i lived with mr. covey one year. during the first six months, of that year, scarce a week passed without his whipping me. i was seldom free from a sore back. my awkwardness was almost always his excuse for whipping me. we were worked fully up to the point of endurance. long before day we were up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams. mr. covey gave us enough to eat, but scarce time to eat it. we were often less than five minutes taking our meals. we were often in the field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us; and at saving-fodder time, midnight often caught us in the field binding blades.",
            "2": "covey would be out with us. the way he used to stand it, was this. he would spend the most of his afternoons in bed. he would then come out fresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words, example, and frequently with the whip. mr. covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands. he was a hard-working man. he knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do. there was no deceiving him. his work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence; and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us. this he did by surprising us. he seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. he always aimed at taking us by surprise. such was his cunning, that we used to call him, among ourselves, \"the snake.\" when we were at work in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, \"ha, ha! come, come! dash on, dash on!\" this being his mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single minute. his comings were like a thief in the night. he appeared to us as being ever at hand. he was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the plantation. he would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to st. michael's, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves. he would, for this purpose, leave his horse tied up in the woods. again, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the house to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till the going down of the sun.",
            "3": "mr. covey's _forte_ consisted in his power to deceive. his life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made conform to his disposition to deceive. he seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the almighty. he would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he. the exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me. he would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. i would at times do so; at others, i would not. my non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion. to show himself independent of me, he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner. in this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. poor man! such was his disposition, and success at deceiving, i do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high god; and this, too, at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery. the facts in the case are these: mr. covey was a poor man; he was just commencing in life; he was only able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he bought her, as he said, for _a breeder_. this woman was named caroline. mr. covey bought her from mr. thomas lowe, about six miles from st. michael's. she was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. she had already given birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he wanted. after buying her, he hired a married man of mr. samuel harrison, to live with him one year; and him he used to fasten up with her every night! the result was, that, at the end of the year, the miserable woman gave birth to twins. at this result mr. covey seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman. such was his joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for caroline during her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done. the children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.",
            "4": "if at any one time of my life more than another, i was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with mr. covey. we were worked in all weathers. it was never too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or snow, too hard for us to work in the field. work, work, work, was scarcely more the order of the day than of the night. the longest days were too short for him, and the shortest nights too long for him. i was somewhat unmanageable when i first went there, but a few months of this discipline tamed me. mr. covey succeeded in breaking me. i was broken in body, soul, and spirit. my natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!"

            "0": "i now come to that part of my life during which i planned, and finally succeeded in making, my escape from slavery. but before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances, i deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction. my reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following: first, were i to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is not only possible, but quite probable, that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties. secondly, such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains. i deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery. it would afford me great pleasure indeed, as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were i at liberty to gratify a curiosity, which i know exists in the minds of many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape. but i must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford. i would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.",
            "1": "i have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the _underground railroad,_ but which i think, by their open declarations, has been made most emphatically the _upper-ground railroad._ i honor those good men and women for their noble daring, and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves. i, however, can see very little good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves escaping; while, upon the other hand, i see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are seeking to escape. they do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst they do much towards enlightening the master. they stimulate him to greater watchfulness, and enhance his power to capture his slave. we owe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north of it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery. i would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. i would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey. let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him; and let him feel that at every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency. let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprints of our flying brother. but enough of this. i will now proceed to the statement of those facts, connected with my escape, for which i am alone responsible, and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself.",
            "2": "in the early part of the year 1838, i became quite restless. i could see no reason why i should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master. when i carried to him my weekly wages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask, \"is this all?\" he was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent. he would, however, when i made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. it had the opposite effect. i regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole. the fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. i always felt worse for having received any thing; for i feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber. my discontent grew upon me. i was ever on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means, i determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with which to make my escape. in the spring of 1838, when master thomas came to baltimore to purchase his spring goods, i got an opportunity, and applied to him to allow me to hire my time. he unhesitatingly refused my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape. he told me i could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in the event of my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me. he exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. he told me, if i would be happy, i must lay out no plans for the future. he said, if i behaved myself properly, he would take care of me. indeed, he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness. he seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to contentment in slavery. but in spite of him, and even in spite of myself, i continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my enslavement, and the means of escape.",
            "3": "about two months after this, i applied to master hugh for the privilege of hiring my time. he was not acquainted with the fact that i had applied to master thomas, and had been refused. he too, at first, seemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he granted me the privilege, and proposed the following terms: i was to be allowed all my time, make all contracts with those for whom i worked, and find my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, i was to pay him three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools, and in board and clothing. my board was two dollars and a half per week. this, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular expenses about six dollars per week. this amount i was compelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time. rain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming, or i must give up my privilege. this arrangement, it will be perceived, was decidedly in my master's favor. it relieved him of all need of looking after me. his money was sure. he received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while i endured all the evils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman. i found it a hard bargain. but, hard as it was, i thought it better than the old mode of getting along. it was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and i was determined to hold on upon it. i bent myself to the work of making money. i was ready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring perseverance and industry, i made enough to meet my expenses, and lay up a little money every week. i went on thus from may till august. master hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer. the ground for his refusal was a failure on my part, one saturday night, to pay him for my week's time. this failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from baltimore. during the week, i had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from baltimore to the camp ground early saturday evening; and being detained by my employer, i was unable to get down to master hugh's without disappointing the company. i knew that master hugh was in no special need of the money that night. i therefore decided to go to camp meeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars. i staid at the camp meeting one day longer than i intended when i left. but as soon as i returned, i called upon him to pay him what he considered his due. i found him very angry; he could scarce restrain his wrath. he said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping. he wished to know how i dared go out of the city without asking his permission. i told him i hired my time and while i paid him the price which he asked for it, i did not know that i was bound to ask him when and where i should go. this reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned to me, and said i should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he should know of, i would be running away. upon the same plea, he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith. i did so; but instead of seeking work, as i had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, i spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work. i did this in retaliation. saturday night, he called upon me as usual for my week's wages. i told him i had no wages; i had done no work that week. here we were upon the point of coming to blows. he raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. i did not allow myself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his hand upon me, it should be blow for blow. he did not strike me, but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future. i thought the matter over during the next day, sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of september, as the day upon which i would make a second attempt to secure my freedom. i now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey. early on monday morning, before master hugh had time to make any engagement for me, i went out and got employment of mr. butler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon what is called the city block, thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me. at the end of the week, i brought him between eight and nine dollars. he seemed very well pleased, and asked why i did not do the same the week before. he little knew what my plans were. my object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this i succeeded admirably. i suppose he thought i was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which i was planning my escape. the second week passed, and again i carried him my full wages; and so well pleased was he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. i told him i would.",
            "4": "things went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was trouble. it is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near. i had a number of warmhearted friends in baltimore,--friends that i loved almost as i did my life,--and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression. it is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery, who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends. the thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which i had to contend. the love of them was my tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else. besides the pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what i had experienced at my first attempt. the appalling defeat i then sustained returned to torment me. i felt assured that, if i failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one--it would seal my fate as a slave forever. i could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of escape. it required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which i should have to pass, in case i failed. the wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually before me. it was life and death with me. but i remained firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of september, 1838, i left my chains, and succeeded in reaching new york without the slightest interruption of any kind. how i did so,--what means i adopted,--what direction i travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,--i must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned."
