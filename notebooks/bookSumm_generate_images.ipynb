he could scarce restrain his wrath. he said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping. he wished to know how i dared go out of the city without asking his permission. i told him i hired my time and while i paid him the price which he asked for it, i did not know that i was bound to ask him when and where i should go. this reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned to me, and said i should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he should know of, i would be running away. upon the same plea, he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith. i did so; but instead of seeking work, as i had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, i spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work. i did this in retaliation. saturday night, he called upon me as usual for my week's wages. i told him i had no wages; i had done no work that week. here we were upon the point of coming to blows. he raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. i did not allow myself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his hand upon me, it should be blow for blow. he did not strike me, but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future. i thought the matter over during the next day, sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of september, as the day upon which i would make a second attempt to secure my freedom. i now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey. early on monday morning, before master hugh had time to make any engagement for me, i went out and got employment of mr. butler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon what is called the city block, thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me. at the end of the week, i brought him between eight and nine dollars. he seemed very well pleased, and asked why i did not do the same the week before. he little knew what my plans were. my object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this i succeeded admirably. i suppose he thought i was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which i was planning my escape. the second week passed, and again i carried him my full wages; and so well pleased was he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. i told him i would.\",\n",
